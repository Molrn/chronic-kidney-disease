# chronic-kidney-disease

This project uses Data Science and AI technologies are used to create a diagnosis process for chronic kidney disease from a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/niteshyadav3103/chronic-kidney-disease-prediction-98-accuracy/input) of patients. I has been realized at [UTBM](https://www.utbm.fr/) during the semester of spring 2023 as a part of the UV [DS50](https://guideuv.utbm.fr/#!/Fr/2022/GI/DS50) taught by [J.Gaber](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jgaber) and [S.Iovleff](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/serge-iovleff-3846673a).

# Files description

This project consists in a machine learning prediction pipeline. Each step of the pipeline is represented by one notebook. Steps generate a some files, which are used in the following steps.  

## Pipeline steps (Jupyter Notebooks)  

| File name                 | Description                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EDA                       | Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset. Specific to CKD                     |
| data_preparation          | Preprocess the dataset into a clean dataset                                   |
| hyperparameter_tuning     | For a set of learning models, optimize its parameters for the dataset         |
| feature_selection         | Select the best features to use for training the dataset                      |
| hand_feature_selection    | Computation of a prediction model made from topic research. Specific to CKD   |
| model_comparison          | Compare the models. Creates various comparison graphs                         | 

## Data files

The pipeline can be adapted to any dataset. To do so, the file has to be placed in a csv file at path `Data/{dataset_name}/original_dataset.csv`. All of the files generated by the pipeline will then be generated in the same directory. By default, the project contains 2 datasets with all of their generated files :
- [Chronic Kidney Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/code/niteshyadav3103/chronic-kidney-disease-prediction-98-accuracy/)
- [Cardiovascular Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
 
| File name                     | Generated during step         | Used for steps                            |
